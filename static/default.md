Gowiki is a simple markdown wiki with the following features:

* markdown syntax w/ github style codeblocks
* distributable as a single binary which runs its own http server
* online customizable styles and page markup
* users and online user signup
* open or closed wikis, user page ownership
* ... by default it looks like [my website](http://jmoiron.net)

Gowiki does not:

* keep a revision history
* keep track of page references or interlinking
* attempt to prevent multiple simultaneous edits
* auto-link WikiWeb style PageNames or require WikiCase urls

The only reserved page names are:

* [/users](/users) - manage wiki users
* [/pages](/pages) - list of wiki pages
* [/config](/config) - - manage wiki config

Create a new page by visiting that URL, or even [Edit this one](/pages/edit/).

[Create a user](/users/create) and [Log in](/users/login) to [Manage the config](/config).
